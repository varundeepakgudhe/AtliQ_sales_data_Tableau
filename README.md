# AtliQ Hardware Sales Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the sales data of AtliQ Hardware, a company that sells hardware products to different sectors in various regions. The company experienced a decrease in sales last year, and the managers want to identify the reasons behind this decline using the available sales data.

## Project Overview

The project involved several steps to analyze and visualize the sales data. The following is an overview of the process:

1. **Data Import**: The sales data was imported from a GitHub repository into MySQL Workbench for further analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Various data analysis techniques were applied, such as examining sales for each year, comparing sales across different cities, and joining tables to gather relevant insights.
3. **Data Modeling**: A star schema was created in Tableau to facilitate data visualization and exploration.
4. **Data Cleaning and ETL**: Data cleaning tasks were performed within Tableau, including handling negative and zero sales values, filtering out irrelevant countries, and converting sales amounts to a consistent currency (INR).
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Multiple visualizations were built in Tableau to showcase the sales data effectively.
6. **Interactive Filters**: Year and month filters were added to the dashboard as slicers, enabling users to select specific time periods for analysis.
7. **Project Documentation**: A README file was prepared to document the entire project, including the steps taken and key findings.

## Key Visualizations

The dashboard consists of several visualizations to provide insights into the sales data. The key visualizations include:

1. **Revenue by Markets**: A bar graph illustrating the revenue generated by different markets.
